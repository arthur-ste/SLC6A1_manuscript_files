# SLC6A1 variant pathogenicity, molecular function, and phenotype: a genetic and clinical analysis

## Abstract

### Genetic variants in the SLC6A1 gene can cause a broad phenotypic disease spectrum by altering the protein function. Thus, systematically curated clinically relevant genotype-phenotype associations are needed to understand the disease mechanism and improve therapeutic decision-making.
### We aggregated genetic and clinical data from 156 individuals with likely pathogenic/ pathogenic (lp/p) SLC6A1 variants and functional data for 184 variants (14.1% lp/p). Clinical and functional data were available for a subset of 116 individuals. We explored the potential associations of variant positions on the GAT1 3D structure with variant pathogenicity, altered molecular function, and phenotype severity using bioinformatic approaches. 
### The GAT1 transmembrane domains 1, 6, and extracellular loop 4 (EL4) were enriched for patient over population variants. Across functionally tested missense variants (n = 156), the spatial proximity from the ligand was associated with loss-of-function in the GAT1 transporter activity. For variants with complete loss of in vitro GABA uptake, we found a 5-fold enrichment in patients having severe disease vs. non-severe disease (P = 3.8e-4, 95% CI: 1.6 - 17.8). 
### In summary, we delineated associations between the 3D structure and variant pathogenicity, variant function, and phenotype in SLC6A1-related disorders. This knowledge supports biology-informed variant interpretation and research on GAT1 function. All our data can be interactively explored in the SLC6A1 Portal (https://slc6a1-portal.broadinstitute.org/).
